# 1. Reflect on some examples from your own work. Write a short paragraph or discuss within a group of where you have a response variable that comes from a Binomial, Poisson, Negative binomial or Normal distribution?

## Your examples will vary depend on your area of work. 
## Response variables that come from a binomial distribution might include a model where you are looking at two outcomes e.g. presence/absence, dead/alive etc. 
## A Poisson response variable will typically be a count, e.g. how many bicycles crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, numbers of wildebeest, number of times a mobile phone game has been played in a day. These are discrete counts, you can't have 4.5 of a wildebeest or 5.5 bicycles crossing the Brookly bridge. 
## Response variables with a negative binomial distribution are a bit harder to detect, but they might include outcomes where you have a lot of zeros, e.g. if you typically only see pods of whales and have a lot of instances with zero whales observed, or where the data is more variable some very high counts and some low counts. 
## Normally distributed response variable might include measurements such as weight or height. It is typically used for continuous variables.

# 2. Experiment with the poisson distribution. What happens when you experiment with the shape parameter, mu?
## We observe that the Poisson distributions
## are unimodal (one peak);
## exhibit positive skew (that decreases as mu increases);
## are centred roughly on mu;
## have variance (spread) that increases as mu increases.



# 3. Experiment with the normal distribution. What happens when you change the variance? What happens when you change the mean?
## Changing the mean will shift where the normal distribution is centered.
## Increasing the variance will widen the distribution (more flat), decreasing the variance will tighten the distribution (more peaked).
